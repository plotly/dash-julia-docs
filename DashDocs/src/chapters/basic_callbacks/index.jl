        In the [previous chapter](/getting-started) on the app `layout` we learned that the
        `app.layout` describes what the app looks like and is a hierarchical tree of components.
        The `DashHtmlComponents` package provides classes for all of the HTML tags, and the keyword
        arguments describe the HTML attributes like `style`, `className`, and `id`. The `DashCoreComponents`
        package generates higher level components like controls and graphs.

        This chapter describes how to make your Dash apps interactive.

        Let's get started with a simple example.

        dcc_markdown("""
        Try typing in the text box. The `children` property of the output
        component updates right away. Let's break down what's happening here:

        1. The "inputs" and "outputs" of our application interface are described
        declaratively by the `callback!` function definition.

        2. In Dash, the inputs and outputs of our application are simply the
        properties of a particular component. In this example, our input is the `value`
        property of of the component with the ID `input`. Our output is the `children` property
        of the compnoent with the ID `output`.

        3. Whenever an input property changes, the callback function will be executed automatically.
        Dash provides the callback function with the new value of the input property as an input argument
        and Dash updates the property of the output component with whatever was returned by the callback
        function.

        4. Don't confuse the `Dash.Input` object with the `DashCoreComponents.Input` object. The former is just used to declare
        inputs of callback functions while the latter is an UI component which is used to render HTML input elements.

        5. Notice how we don't set a value for the `children` property of the `input` component in the `layout`. When
        the Dash app starts, it automatically calls all the callbacks with the initial values of the input componets in
        order to populate the initial state of the output components. In this example, if you specified something like
        `html_div(id=\"output\", children=\"hello world\")`, it would get overwritten when the app starts by what is
        returned by the callback function.

        It's sort of like programming with Microsoft Excel: whenever an input cell changes, all of the cells that
        depend on that cell will get updated automatically. This is called \"Reactive Programming\".

        Remember how every component was described entirely through its set of keyword arguments? Those properties are important now.
        With Dash's interactivity, we can dynamically update any of those properties through a callback function.
        Frequently we'll update the `children` of a component to display new text or the `figure` of a `Graph` component to
        display new data, but we could also update the `style` of a component or even the available `options` of a `Dropdown`
        component!

        Let's take a look at another example where a `Slider` updates a `Graph`.

        dcc_markdown("""
        In this example, the `value` property of the `Slider` component is the input of the app and the output of the app is the `figure` property of the `Graph` component. When the `value` of the `Slider` changes, Dash calls the callback function with new value. The function filters the dataframe with this new value, constructs a `figure` object, and returns it to the Dash app.

        There are a few nice patterns in this example:

        1. After loading `CSV` and `DataFrames` we are able to load up an example dataset bundled with `PlotlyJS`. We load this into a DataFrame and filter datasets in memory.

        2. We load our dataframe at the start of the app: `df = dataset(Dataframe, "gapminder")`. This dataframe `df` is in the global state of the app and can be read inside callback functions.

        3. Loading data into memory can be expensive. By loading data at the start of the app instead of inside callback functions, we ensure that this operation is only done with the app server starts. When a user visits the app or interacts with the app, the data (the `df`) is already in memory. If possible, expensive initialization (like downloading or querying data) should be done in the global scope of the app instead of within callback functions.

        4. The callback does not modify the original data, it just creates copies of the dataframe by filtering. This is important: *your callbacks should never mutate variables outside of their scope*. If your callbacks modify global state, then one user's session might affect the next user's session and when the app is deployed on a server with multiple processes or threads, those modifications will not be shared across sessions.

        5. We are turning on transitions with `layout.transition` to give an idea of how the dataset evolves with time: transitions allow the chart to update from one state to the next smoothly, as if it were animated.

        html_h1("Dash App With Multiple Inputs"),

        In Dash, any `Output` can have multiple `Input` components.
        Here's an example that binds five Inputs (the `value` property of
        2 `Dropdown` components, 2 `RadioItems` components, and
        1 `Slider` component) to 1 Output component (the `figure` property of the `Graph` component).

        In this example, the callback function gets called whenever the `value`

        The input arguments of the callback function are the new or current value of
        each of the `Input` properties, in the order that they were specified.

        Even though only a single `Input` changes at a time (a user can only
        change the value of a single `Dropdown` at a given moment), Dash collects
        the current state of all of the specified `Input` properties and passes them
        into your callback function for you. Your callback functions are always
        guaranteed to have be passed the representative state of the app.

        The final callback displays the selected `value` of each component. If you
        change the `value` of the countries `RadioItems` component, Dash will wait until
        the `value` of the cities component is updated before calling the final callback.
